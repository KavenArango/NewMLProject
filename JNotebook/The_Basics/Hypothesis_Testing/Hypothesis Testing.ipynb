    "## Statistical Hypothesis Testing\n",
    "### Null and Alternate Hypothesis\n",
    "Statistical **Hypothesis Testing** is making an assumption (hypothesis) and testing with the test data to see if the assumption was correct or incorrect. Every hypothesis test, regardless of the data population and other parameters involved, requires the three steps below.\n",
    "* Making an initial assumption.\n",
    "* Collecting evidence (data).\n",
    "* Based on the available evidence (data), deciding whether to reject or not reject the initial assumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "The initial assumption made is called **Null Hypothesis (H-0)** and the alternative (opposite) to the **Null Hypothesis** is called the **Alternate Hypothesis (H-A)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Two widely used approach to **hypothesis testing** are\n",
    "* Critical value approach\n",
    "* p-value approach\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Critical value** approach involves comparing the observed test statistic to some cutoff value, called the **Critical Value**. If the test statistic is more extreme (i.e. more than the **Upper Critical Value** or less than the **Lower Critical Value**) than the **Critical Value**, then the null hypothesis is rejected in favor of the alternative hypothesis. If the test statistic is not as extreme as the critical value, then the null hypothesis is not rejected.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **p-value** approach involves determining the probability of observing a more extreme test statistics in the direction of **Alternate Hypothesis**, assuming the null hypothesis were true. \n",
    "\n",
    "If the **p-value** is less than (or equal to) **α (the accepted level of p-value)**, then the null hypothesis **is rejected** in favor of the alternative hypothesis. If the P-value is greater than **α (the critical value)**, then the null hypothesis **is not rejected**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Z-Score and p-Value\n",
    "In this section we are just learning the definitions of **Z-Score** and **p-Value** and their inter-relations. In a subsequent section we will use the Z-Score, p-value along with **Level of Confidence** or **Level of Significance** to test a hypothesis (i.e. Reject (i.e. the Alternate Hypothesis is acceptedas the new norm. the Null Hypothesis or Fail to Reject the Null Hypothesis (i.e. Null Hypothesis remains valid)\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Z-Score** of a sample of data is a score that expresses the value of a distribution in standard deviation with respect to the mean. It shows how far (**how many Standard Deviation**) a specific value of data is from the sample **Mean**.\n",

    "\n",
    "However, depending on the data we are trying to test (in the case 53) compared to the currently known data (National Average = 60, Standard Deviation = 3) we may have to use a slightly different formula. Do do that we need to learn the **Left Tail** and **Right Tail** tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Left-Tail, Right-Tail and Two-Tail Tests of Hypothesis\n",
    "If the data we are trying to test (53) is **less than** the **Mean** (60) we use the **Left Tail Test**. If the data (say the class average was 68 as opposed to 53) is **greater than** the **Mean** (60), we use the **Right Tail Test**.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a **Right Tail Test** the formula for p-value (again using a Python Library function) is\n",
