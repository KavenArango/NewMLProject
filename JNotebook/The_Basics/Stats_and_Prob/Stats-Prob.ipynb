    "## Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is ANOVA\n",
    "ANOVA or Analysis of Variance is a set of statistical tests to test if there is a **significant** difference between the **means** of a set of samples. It tests if the means of various samples of data are (***statistically***) equal or not. ANOVA, in its simplest form, tests if at least one of the sample mean is significantly different from the means of other sample. It does not conclude if means of **more than one** samples are different from other sample means. Nor does it make **pair-wise** comparisons between the samples. More advanced form of ANOVA tests and helps researchers conclude these aspects of the data (we will not discuss those).\n",
    "\n",
    "An important fact to note that while we use ANOVA to test if the sample means differ significantly, we actually compare the **variances**. Hence the name **Analysis of Variance**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is this test for?\n",
    "The one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) is used to determine whether there are any statistically significant differences between the means of three or more independent (unrelated) groups. This guide will provide a brief introduction to the one-way ANOVA, including the assumptions of the test and when you should use this test. If you are familiar with the one-way ANOVA, you can skip this guide and go straight to how to run this test in SPSS Statistics by clicking here.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What does this test do?\n",
    "The one-way ANOVA compares the means between the groups you are interested in and determines whether any of those means are statistically significantly different from each other. Specifically, it tests the **Null Hypothesis**:\n",

    "                                H-0: µ-0 = µ-1 = µ-2 ........µ-k\n",
    "\n",
    "where µ = group mean and k = number of groups. \n",
    "\n",
    "If, however, the one-way ANOVA returns a statistically significant result, we accept the **Alternative Hypothesis (HA)**, which is that there are **at least** one group mean that is statistically significantly different from each other group means.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, it is important to realize that the one-way ANOVA is an omnibus test statistic and cannot tell you which specific groups were statistically significantly different from each other, only that at least two groups were. To determine which specific groups differed from each other, you need to use a post hoc test. Post hoc tests are described later in this guide.\n",
